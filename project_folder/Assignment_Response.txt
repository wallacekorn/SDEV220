## Describe the test results in your own words.  
The test ran two seperate tests. 
The first checks to see if the sum() function adds 3 integers together and is tested against the value 6.
The second checks to see if the sum() function adds 3 fractions together and is tested against the value 1.
The first test was successful but the second failed.
This gave an overall F return as the sum of the fractions (9/10) is not equal to 1 and not all the tests were successful.

## What do the test results mean?
The results mean that the sum function in 
"project_folder\my_sum\__init__.py" 
can correctly arrive at the sum of integers but not fractions.
